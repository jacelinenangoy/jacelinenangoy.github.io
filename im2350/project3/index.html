<!-- intro: interactive landing page of portfolio-->
<!-- this is a prototype for my portfolio which highlights navigation with the use of click and drag for a more fun and engaging visual interactivity-->

<!-- in my initial concept idea and presentation, I created a simpler version of this interactive (with draggable project images, with hover functions and popup when clicked on)-->
<!-- but after experimenting with my visual style and set of media, I decided to pursue a film roll look rather than an assortment of images like a collage -->
<!-- please see my archive section for the draft of this project (constructed like my presentation idea) before I changed it into the film roll look-->

<!-- film roll is representative of how each project is connected (same roll, all created by me), and yet each "photo" depicts a different moment (different projects)-->

<!-- note: all photos and images are owned by me, hence no need for copyright licences or credits ^-^ -->
<!-- I would love to continue this by incorporating more projects and developing a scrollable element in the future -->

        as the water has to go through the filter, which produces a different taste to a much quicker espresso style coffee! <br>
