<!-- hello! my concept for this website is a jazz music discover website, similar to how spotify does discover weekly, 
  which ultimately plays an artist's song on loop on the media player.-->

<!-- added attribute: I added an auto loop function as I found it would be nice to have the song on repeat in the background as you browse the website, rather than having to manually click play over and over again-->

    <li><h3> This is a special smooth jazz song by Petermann from his 2021 album, <a href="https://www.jamendo.com/album/454882/golden-star">Golden Star.</a> 
      Having 21 songs in this album, this song has become a hidden gem for jazz enthusiasts. Golden Star was inspired by the weather, special events and small instances in life.
      <br>
      <br>
      Today's song <em>Indigo Moon</em> was chosen by our curator as it perfectly depicts the mysterious winter nights recently. 
      Us at <em>Jazzy Radio</em> hope you can enjoy this groove no matter where you are!
