        <h2>Week 2 Questions:</h2>

        <br> 

        <h3>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
        <p>My eyes were first drawn to the <em>moving</em> elements of the page - the video of the hand interacting with the powerplug, as well as the moving ascii wave animation.
            I was also drawn to the page's background, with all the horizontal and vertical lines, which at first I thought were quite distracting as they drew my eyes away from the textual information,
            but ended up thinking it was a nice personal touch as a background. 
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hovering over the <em>different coloured text</em> to reveal a blue colour</li>
            <li>Clicking on the radio buttons <input type="radio"> &nbsp; and checkboxes  <input type="checkbox"> </li> 
            <li>Clicking and sliding the range slider, in which I played around making the element margins bigger and smaller <input type="range"></li>
            <li>Selecting a portion of the ascii wave animation and watching it move across to the left ´¨`*•.¸¸.•*´¨`*•.¸¸.•*´¨`*•.¸¸.•*´¨`*•.¸¸.•*´¨`*•.¸</li>
            <li>Trying to click on the videos and photos but noticing nothing happens</li>
            <li>Closing tabs by clicking 'x' and revealing more photos and elements</li>
            <li>When I reached the vertical element, I scrolled down to the bottom of the page and scrolled back up</li>
            <br>
            <video controls muted width="500px" height="200px" controls="controls">
                <source src="ss.mov" type="video/mp4" />
               </video>

            <li>Once I closed all the element tabs and could not click on anything else, I manually refreshed the page</li>
        </ul>
        <br>


        <h3>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
        <p>I spent the most time adjusting the range slider and closing the different page element tabs by clicking 'x'.
            I first experimented with the slider as it was quite engaging how each element's corners rounded off at different times depending on the size (height of element) - I spent some time analysing which tabs rounded first and last.
            <br>
            I also spent time closing different tabs and saw more page elements were revealed, such as the photo of Max's face, so I continued closing more to reveal the photo of his cat and different graphics.
            After seeing how that affected the layout of the page, I then ended up closing the elements in a random order - then refreshing to try closing again in another order.
            <br>
            <br>
            <video controls muted width="500px" height="200px" controls="controls">
                <source src="ss2.mov" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
        <p>The most common actions were <em>clicking and sliding. </em>
            Whether it be the radio buttons, checkboxes, range slider, the 'x' mark ballot box, almost all interactive aspects involves myself clicking on a specific area with my mouse pointer.
            Some items such as the repeated line of radio buttons had to be double clicked to be turned off, whereas the checkboxes were standard click to tick and click to untick.
            Another note was that the scroll wheel was not necessarily used (until you get to the vertical element) as the page is designed for a standard 1920x1080 ratio and everything is contained in the area.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
        <p>The primary intended goal of this interactive experience is to make the user engage with the website and stay on the screen for as long as possible. 
            With a descriptive bio stating he is an "Artist building tools for play, creativity, & communication.", I think Max is clear with his intentions for users to acknowledge his creativity and playfulness through his showcase of skills as an artist and software developer
            I believe that Max is both trying to get website visitors to engage and play around with his website, and eventually associate Max as a creative and experimental artist. 
            His interactive website also has no standard rules and layout, which allows the user to navigate freely and gives great freedom of choice - branding Max as a creator without limits.
            
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
        <p>I think the way Max has used the user interactive experience as a means of distracting the user is a smart idea, as the average web visitor would typically play around with the elements, 
            which meant longer screen time and encouraging experimentation, rather than if the information was presented in purely a vertical scrolling text form. This assists in presenting himself as a non conforming traditiional artist.
            <br>
            <br>
            The choice of media also plays a big part in communicating his goal of showcasing his creativity. 
            The looping video of the hands plugging and unplugging the extension cord into itself is an unusual but engaging media as it sparks curiosity and intrigue to the average person watching it.
            The additional photos also indicate his playful and quirky personality as the photo of himself and his cat are very natural and not posed or professional, making Max seem more relatable and approachable.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
        <p>As there are many interactive elements on the page, I think an average audience would take time experimenting clicking on different buttons and seeing what they do.
            The repetitive aspect of the interactives such as the row of checkboxes and radio buttons also indicate repetitive action to be done, so I think the user would click on and off all the buttons out of curiosity expecting a result. 
            As there were elements hidden on the right, closing the tabs and revealing new interactives or photos were also a positive reinforcement of clicking on the 'x' buttons, meaning people are more likely to stay on the website and click until all hidden elements are uncovered.
           <br>
           <br>
            Once all the interactives have been played around, and all the elements have been closed away, there is nothing left to do except refresh the page and start again. Depending on how quickly the user gets bored of repetitive tasks, 
           some users such as myself, might linger and continue to refresh the page to see if there are any changes or anything new. But after all the clicking, there is nothing else to do other than click the hyperlinks or exit the tab.
           <br>
           The <a href="https://maxbittker.com/mailto"target="_blank">"send me a letter"</a> aspect however, is very engaging and I think users can interact with this for a long time, as it is highly customisable and allows great creative freedom. 
           From the satisfying sound effects, to the visual input, this tool feels like a fun drawing activity!
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
        <p>As stated in the previous question, the many repetitive interactives indicate the user having to complete the same task/ action multiple times.
            There is no right or wrong way to interact with the elements, such as you can tick or untick all the checkboxes in any particular order, without any effect other than the visual input.
            Over time, the user will eventually get bored of the small interactives as there are no direct results, leading them to click other aspects of the website such as the hyperlinks to Max's works, blog, the send me a letter, or to head to his socials page.
            I think this website only acts as a fun platform to showcase some of his skills, but over time, the main goal is to direct the user to other works by Max.
        </p>

        <h2>Week 2 Questions:</h2>
        <br>

        <h3>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Max's portfolio's background references a <em>zen garden, puzzle</em>, with all the uniform and balanced lines and curves.</li>
            <li>The send me a letter icon is a skeuomorph of a <em>paper envelope</em> &#128233;</li>
            <li>The radio buttons in a row reminds me of a <em>string of beads</em> in jewellery or bracelet.<input type="radio"><input type="radio"><input type="radio"><input type="radio"><input type="radio"></li> 
            <li>The wavy pattern inside the marquee is also reminiscent of <em>sparkles and waves of water</em> </li>
            <li>The checkboxes remind me of settings and signing declaration forms such as the terms and conditions of a file <input type="checkbox"> </li>
            <li>The range slider reminds me of music settings, especially when adjusting volume and also the playback of a song <br>
                <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/727/727240.png"><input type="range"> <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/727/727269.png"></li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As the background is reminiscent of a zen garden, at first I thought of acting with intention with each of the page elements, </li>
            <li>The envelope icon indicates the action of sending a message/ mail, and communicating with another person. </li>
            <li>The radio buttons and checkboxes indicate the interaction of clicking and how we should tick and untick items.</li>
            <li>The range slider also encourages action for the user to adjust the setting to whichever preference they like</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
        <p>I think the associations with specific interactive elements indicate what I expected, and whether it fulfilled my expectations or not, altered how I feel. 
            An example is when I clicked all the checkboxes expecting a result, but nothing happened, whereas when I played with the range slider, the instant visual change made me feel happy and intrigued.
            Specific icons such as the <em>envelope</em> for sending a message, gives off a pleasant feeling as the skeuomorph of the paper envelope gives the intention of sending a letter less daunting and more of a friendly message.
            The <em>ascii waves </em> animation also subconsciously makes me think of movement and progression, hence feeling like there is something happening and making me feel satisfied.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
        <p>The most frustrating part was the fact that the interaction <em> cannot be undone</em>, and how there were no back or undo buttons on the page besides the web browser itself. 
            Once an element has been deleted, it cannot be resurfaced untill I refreshed the page, which ultimately brought back all the elements in the original order.
            With this, I also found the lack of backthreading a little unusual, such as if I pressed on the <a href="https://maxbittker.com/mailto"target="_blank">"send me a letter"</a>
            there was no way to go back to the original home screen of the portfolio website without manually clicking the back button on the browser.
            <br>
            <br> 
            Other than that, I also found it a little annoying how the elements cannot be moved around and has to be in the specific order the creator intended - 
            I was expecting an interactive layout with the ability to rearrange but instead, got a feeling of dissatisfaction when there were times that the uneven spacing and white space between page elements were unpleasant to look at.
            
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
        <p>The most satisfying part of this interaction was clicking all the <em>'x' </em>symbol on the elements to make them disappear. 
            This process is reminiscent of closing unwanted popup tabs or dismissing notifications, so I found it pleasing to make them all close, which left a nice and empty background.
            <br>
            The range slider was also very fun and satisfying to play around as the results of my action were instantly visible. 
            The lines and corners of the elements rounded off with my actions, creating instant gratification and that aspect makes it very pleasing to use.
            <br>
            I also loved the <a href="https://maxbittker.com/mailto"target="_blank">"send me a letter"</a> interactive as it was a very fun and playful activity hidden away. 
            From the sound effects of a typewriter, to bouncy sounds when undoing, to the ability to erase the template itself, and even overlap text on one another. I think this was very satisfying as a child-like innocence activity to do.
           <br>

            </video>
